## Original Description

```
MOWIN' MAN (tm) is dedicated to the "weekend warriors" who face the ongoing struggle of taming their yards. When we called to inform Glenn that Mowin' Man was an After Dark Contest award winner, his wife had to call him in from mowing the lawn. No joke.

The mowing ritual was strangely compelling to all of us at Berkeley Systems, since we haven't even seen grass since the beginning of the great drought and the end of the 60's.
