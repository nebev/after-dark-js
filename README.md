# After Dark Screensavers in Javascript

![Alt text](docs/images/mowin-man.png?raw=true "Mowin Man")

Are you a sucker for the nostalgic days where monitors would suffer from burn-in? Do you miss the old screensavers?

[After Dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Dark_(software)) was a series of screensavers popular in the late 80s and early 90s. 

This repository contains recreations of my favourite savers from the After Dark 3.0 era.

## Using this as a screensaver

There are many applications out there which allow you to use a webpage as a screensaver on modern operating systems.

Check out [Web View Screensaver](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver) for MacOS or [Web Page Screensaver](https://github.com/cwc/web-page-screensaver) for Windows.

There are a few projects that have done other modules. I've linked them here.
